        <p>Hi Bebe! Thanks for saying yes (as if you really had a choice lol) hahaha and I know by this time you're working already, but I planned a little something for us. Soooo, the details you soooo eagerly wanna know are written below:</p>

        <p>First things first, I‚Äôll be picking you up at 2pm tomorrow (January 21, 2025). Can you please try to sleep as soon as your work ends? It will be a long day and I don't want you getting tired. haha. </p>

        <p>Second, you're probably wondering, where are we going? The answer is: You'll find out when we get there HAHAHA. I know you don't like secrets but please let me keep the exact place a secret for now. I put a lot of thought process and insights into it so revealing it now will spoil the surprise. I know, I know you'll tell me anywhere with me is a great place and that it's not about the destination but about the person you are with - but allow me to be extra just this once. Hehehe</p>

        <p>Third, please wear something nice and comfy! Hmm, I‚Äôll be wearing my white long sleeves (the one I showed you last time), black plain shorts and white sneakers. Match my vibe? hahahaha mwa.</p>

        <p>Lastly, one small thing to note: my car will be on coding tomorrow, so we‚Äôll need to head out after the window hours. That would be after 8pm. Can you please bring your laptop? Just in case we won't be able to get home by the time your shift starts. </p>

        <p>That's it. If you have questions, let me know. See you tomorrow, mogmog üòõ ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
